def get_or_create(session, model, defaults=None, kwargs):
   ```
   - `session`: This is the connection to the database where you can perform queries (like searching or adding data).
   - `model`: This represents the type of record you want to work with (like a table in the database).
   - `defaults`: This is an optional dictionary of default values that you can use when creating a new record.
   - `kwargs`: This allows you to pass any number of keyword arguments (key-value pairs) to specify what you're looking for in the database.

1. Searching for an Existing Record:
   ```python
   instance = session.query(model).filter_by(kwargs).first()
   ```
   - Here, the function tries to find a record in the database that matches the criteria you provided in `kwargs`.
   - `filter_by(kwargs)` means it will look for records where the columns match the key-value pairs you specified.
   - `first()` returns the first matching record or `None` if no match is found.

2. Checking if the Record Exists:
   ```python
   if instance:
       return instance, False
   ```
   - If `instance` is found (meaning a record exists), the function returns that record and `False` to indicate that it did not create a new record.

3. Creating a New Record:
   ```python
   else:
       params = dict((k, v) for k, v in kwargs.iteritems() if not isinstance(v, ClauseElement))
       params.update(defaults or {})
       instance = model(params)
       session.add(instance)
   ```
   - If no record is found, it prepares to create a new one.
   - It filters out any special objects (called `ClauseElement`) from `kwargs` to ensure only simple key-value pairs are used.
   - It combines any default values from `defaults` with the parameters from `kwargs`.
   - Then, it creates a new instance of the `model` using these parameters.

4. Adding the New Record to the Database:
   ```python
   session.add(instance)
   return instance, True
   ```
   - The new record (instance) is added to the session, which means itâ€™s now ready to be saved to the database.
   - The function returns the new record and `True` to indicate that it did create a new record.

Summary
- Purpose: The function checks if a record exists in the database based on the criteria provided. If it does, it returns that record. If not, it creates a new record with the specified values.
- Return Values: It returns two values:
  - The record (either found or newly created).
  - A boolean (`False` if found, `True` if created).

Example Usage
Imagine you have a database of users, and you want to either find a user by their email or create a new one if they don't exist:

```python
user, created = get_or_create(session, UserModel, defaults={'name': 'New User'}, email='example@example.com')
```
- This will search for a user with the email 'example@example.com'.
- If found, it returns the user and `False`.
- If not found, it creates a new user with the name 'New User' and the specified email, and returns the new user and `True`.
