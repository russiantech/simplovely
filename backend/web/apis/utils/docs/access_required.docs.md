# `access_required` Decorator

## Overview

The `access_required` decorator is designed to manage access control in a Flask application using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). It allows developers to specify required roles for a route while providing the flexibility to grant access to admin users or the current user based on the request context. The decorator can also enforce strict access control, allowing only specified roles without any fallback.

## Purpose

This decorator enhances the security of the application by ensuring that only authorized users can access specific routes. It combines the functionality of role-based access control with specific checks for administrative privileges and current user identity, alongside the option for strict access control.

## Usage

### Importing the Decorator

To use the `access_required` decorator, import it into your Flask application:

```python
from your_module import access_required
```

### Applying the Decorator

You can apply the `access_required` decorator to your route functions as follows:

```python
@user_bp.route('/admin', methods=['GET'])
@access_required('admin', strict=True)  # Only admin can access
def admin_dashboard():
    return jsonify({"message": "Welcome to the admin dashboard."}), 200

@user_bp.route('/developer', methods=['GET'])
@access_required('developer', strict=True)  # Only developer can access
def developer_dashboard():
    return jsonify({"message": "Welcome to the developer dashboard."}), 200

@user_bp.route('/users/<username>', methods=['GET'])
@access_required('admin', 'editor')  # Admin or editor can access
def get_user(username):
    return jsonify({"message": "User details retrieved successfully."}), 200
```

### Parameters

- `*required_roles`: A variable-length argument list that specifies the roles required to access the decorated route.
- `strict (bool)`: An optional boolean parameter. If set to `True`, only users with the specified roles will have access. If set to `False` or omitted, the decorator allows access for admin users or the current user as well.

### Behavior

1. **JWT Authentication**: The decorator requires a valid JWT token for access. If the token is missing or invalid, a `401 Unauthorized` response is automatically returned.

2. **Strict Access Control**:
   - If `strict=True`, the decorator checks if the current user has one of the specified roles. If the user does not meet this requirement, a `403 Forbidden` response is returned.

3. **Non-Strict Access Control**:
   - If `strict` is not specified or set to `False`, the decorator first checks if the current user is an admin or matches the requested username.
   - If the user is not an admin and does not match the username, the decorator checks for the specified roles.
   - If the user has any of the required roles or if `'*'` is included in the roles list, access is granted. Otherwise, a `403 Forbidden` response is returned.

### Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how the `access_required` decorator can be used in a Flask route:

```python
@user_bp.route('/settings', methods=['POST'])
@access_required('admin', 'settings_editor', strict=False)  # Admin or settings editor can access
def update_settings():
    # Logic to update settings
    return jsonify({"message": "Settings updated successfully."}), 200
```

## Conclusion

The `access_required` decorator provides a powerful and flexible tool for implementing role-based access control in Flask applications. By combining role checks with options for strict access, it allows developers to manage user permissions effectively.
